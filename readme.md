# Balista
## A Basic Harpoon for Windows

Inspired by [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon), Balista is a fast switcher for windows (later hopefully *nix, macos) and allows you to tag up to 9 windows and instantly recall them. 

PRs, tests, os support welcome.

- Add github release  and actions
- Turn into windows service
- Add better gui to allow switching numbers rather replace
- Allow customising of key shortcuts
